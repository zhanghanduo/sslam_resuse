# If cubicle set to 1, then you have to open cubicle_detect process to generate cubicle_topic in obstacle msgs format!
# Otherwise you will not be able to correctly start the system.
# We suggest set cubicle to 0 in open area or on low computation capability platform.
# Set to 1 in heavy traffic area.

# If gps_initial is set to 1, then the initial robot body pose is aligned with GPS pose at the initial moment, for visualization.
# Furthermore the pose graph saved has global information for better prior map use.
